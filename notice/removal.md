Dear Golff Users:

Due to low pledged funds, Golff Finance has decided to removal the HLTC and HPT pools in the Heco Vault and to removal the G-HLTC and G-HPT mining pools in its Farm. The TUSD pool in the BSC Vault has been removed, and the G-TUSD pool in the Farm has been removed. Users can retrieve their G-HLTC, G-HPT, and G-TUSD from their Farm pools first, and then go to their respective Vault to withdraw all their funds.

Removal Time: November 3, 2021, 8:00 (GMT-4)
