Golff.Finance is committed to providing safe and reliable services to users, and the security of the system has always been a top priority for the team's development. Although Golff has been strictly reviewed by multiple auditors, there is still the possibility of vulnerabilities considering the ever-changing nature of DeFi's product ecology.



For the sake of Golff's stable development and the safety of its users' assets, Golff is now launching a bug bounty program. We hope to discover more professional security researchers, software developers and white-hat hackers to participate in this program through the campaign. If you find a security bug, we would be happy to work with you to resolve it quickly and offer you a reward of up to $20,000.
