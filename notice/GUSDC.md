Dear Golff Users:

Golff Heco Lend G-Token will launch a new collateralized lending pool for G-USDC, G-MDX, G-DOT, G-UNI, G-FIL, and G-BCH at 22:00 (GMT-4) on November 25, 2021. Users can deposit these 6 G-Token assets into the Heco Lend and borrow against this collateral, and the borrowed funds can be re-deposited into the Vault or used in other ways to gain additional revenue.

At the same time all G-Token collateral can get additional GOF mining rewards, the original G-Token Farm pool rewards will all be transferred to the lending collateral rewards.

**Noted:**

- G-Token lending collateral rate is 10%
- G-Token currently only supports collateral deposit, not lending.

G-Token collateralized lending is the first product launched by Golff Finance, which uses Vault credentials (G-Token) as collateral for lending. It is a new model of Vault+lending revolving combination mining. G-Token is the equity credential Token of Golff Vault, and users can deposit G-Token into the Lend pool to collateralize and lend out any assets. The borrowed funds can be re-deposited in the Lend pool or used in other ways to obtain additional revenue. The borrowed funds can be re-deposited into the Lend pool or used for additional income in other ways, thus achieving “leverage” and multiple income combinations.
