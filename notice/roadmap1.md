Dear Golff users:

After more than a year of rapid development since its official launch in September 2020, Golff Finance has gained some influence of its own in the DeFi aggregator space. However, the cryptocurrency industry is changing rapidly, and while we are actively embracing the changes in the industry, we have to continue to expand our market reach and keep Golff Finance sitting at the top of the DeFi ecosystem.

With the new Roadmap V2, Golff Finance will start a new journey of “route upgrade” in the next year’s development route plan.

Roadmap V2 will be different from the previous version. Roadmap V2 will focus on exploring more ways to explore NFT+DeFi and meta-universe, continuing to promote multi-chain deployment, building a global developer community, constructing a user on-chain credit system, and enhancing the liquidity of GOF multi-chain tokens in CEX and DEX, etc.

Roadmap V2 disclosed that it will continue to open the GOF deep cooperation program, which can provide financial support to close partners in addition to mutual mining, in order to open up the ecosystem within the system.

In 2022, Golff Finance will build a credit system on the chain of users and gradually build a Light, Open and Free Financial World. The current One-Stop Services Encrypted Bank is only one of the infrastructures of the future Golff DeFi-World. The next step will be to conduct multi-dimensional matrix analysis through the raw data accumulated on the chain, and then integrate and process the data to build a unified identification of a complete user profile in combination with NFT. G-Dao will be used as the governance token to make the project governance fully community-based, so that users can actively and fairly participate in the project governance and make profits in DeFi-World. We also enable users to profit and participate in the governance of this DeFi-World.

The future Golff is not only an aggregator or a one-stop crypto bank. It will be more of an on-chain credit system + financial system in the future and will be integrated into various meta-universe ecologies to provide image sketching for users. We continue to write a new chapter and open up infinite possibilities for Golff’s future.

To thank you for your continued interest and support, we are launching a airdrop campaign on the Roadmap V2 page to give away 10,000 GOFs. Users are welcome to participate. Address: https://golff.finance/#/roadmap

Next, we will continue to provide users with unique product experience and better service with the new look of Roadmap V2!
