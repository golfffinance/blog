Dear Golff Users：

Golff Finance will launch the world’s first lending product that uses G-Token assets (Vault Token) as collateral, allowing users to deposit G-Tokens as collateral and lend out any assets, increasing the utilization rate of funds on top of the original income, achieving a certain “leverage effect” and diversify the income portfolio.

Golff will officially launch the Heco G-Token collateralized lending on November 3, 2021 at 00:00 (GMT-4). The first phase supports tokens: G-USDT, G-HUSD, G-ETH, G-BTC, G-HT. Users can deposit these 5 G-Token assets into the Heco Lend and use them as collateral for borrowing, and the borrowed funds can be re-deposited into the Vault or used in other ways to gain additional revenue. At the same time all G- Token collateral can get additional GOF mining rewards, the original G-Token Fram rewards will all be transferred to the borrowing collateral rewards.

Note: G-Token currently only supports collateral deposit, not lending.

We have also updated and optimized the Golff Lend section to cater to more users’ usage habits.

G-Token collateralized lending can increase users’ revenue by improving capital utilization while protecting their original revenue. At the same time, the model both increases the demand for loans from Golff Lend and stimulates the deposit market, thus achieving a positive cycle of Lend operation.

### **Additional Notes:**

**What is a G-Token?**

G-Token is an equity Token of Golff Vault, each token in the Vault corresponds to an exclusive G-Token. e.g. G-USDT is the equity G-Token generated by USDT deposited in the Vault. Represents the user’s equity share of USDT assets in the Vault.
