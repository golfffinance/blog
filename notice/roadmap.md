Dear Golff users:



Based on the official launch of Golff Roadmap V2, in order to thank all users for your continued concern and support, Golff Finance is launching the campaign " Support Golff Roadmap V2 to get 10,000 GOF airdrop reward". The campaign lasts for 30 days. During the campaign period, users can participate by clicking on the Roadmap V2 page to support and leave comments.



**Event Period:** Nov 15, 2021, 22:00 - Dec 14, 2021, 22:00 (GMT-4)

**Participants:** All Golff users



**Event Description:**

- The more Supports completed during the campaign period, the more rewards will be airdropped.
- Each address can be Support multiple times, but only once a day, i.e. up to 30 Supports per address.

- Reward calculation: 10000GOF/total number of Supports * number of Supports per address.
- The Support message must be related to Golff, otherwise it will be considered as invalid Support.

- The rewards will be announced within 7 working days after the end of the campaign, and users will collect them by themselves on the BSC of the corresponding address.
