### A year of constantly improving

On October 5th , 2020 the Ethereum version of the Vault 1.0, which is Golff’s aggregator version 1.0, is to achieve the DeFi protocol with the best revenue strategy configuration. In the meantime, equity G-Token was launched.

On November 12th , 2020 the Ethereum version of the Vault 2.0 was launched. It was the upgraded version based on the 1.0. The G-Token was upgraded to G-V2Token, and the economic model was newly upgraded.

On March 5th, 2021 the Heco version Vault was launched, which is the Earning collection based on the Huobi Ecochain. It is a DeFi protocol that automatically implements the best revenue strategy configuration, to reduce the income lost due to abnormal information.

On April 15th, 2021 the Heco version Lend product was launched. By getting the most prioritized lending rate of the Heco chain, the user can experience more convenient and low cost lend service. Meanwhile, deposit or lend can get GOF rewards. .

Furthermore, Golff has completed cooperation with outstanding projects such as Chainlink, Polygon, Channels, etc. Golff also held more than 80 AMAs in world wide communities.


### A year of continuous development and bringing benefits to users

This year, the Golff platform accumulated over $951 million in finance management for users, and brought over $7.72 million revenue to users.

Looking back on this year, Golff continued to make efforts in the business sector, from deploying a single-chain revenue aggregator on Ethereum to developing a multi-chain aggregation ecosystem. Currently, it has supported three major mainstream chains, the ETH chain, the BSC chain, and the Heco chain. From only supporting single currency mining, to LP pledge mining. The product form already has Vault, farm, lending, cross-chain bridge, DAO governance, etc.

The number of Golff Vaults has increased from 2 at the beginning to the existing 78, including 36 for the Heco version, 34 for the BSC version, and 8 for the ETH version. The ever-growing Golff continues to develop new DeFi strategy protocols, and at the same time, it continues to achieve higher returns for users.


### A year without Slack, but safe and zero accidents

DeFi (decentralized finance) is open to everyone, removes middlemen in the financial system and brings a more convenient and faster financial experience. However, the outstanding security issues of smart contracts have become the biggest challenge in the DeFi industry, which inevitably causes users to worry and doubt.

For users, the most important thing is asset security. The Golff team attaches great importance to the safety of the product and the entire ecology. Golff upholds safety as the first principle. Over the past year, there have been zero accidents in safe operation, which effectively protects the interests of users.

The smart contracts of all Golff products have been audited by many security agencies including CertiK, ChainsGuard Technology, KnownSec, PeckShield, and BlockSec to ensure the safety of users’ funds. Golff and these security companies continue to maintain close contact and work together to create a better Defi security environment through friendly cooperation. Recently, Golff joined the CertiK Skynet scanning system, and obtained a comprehensive security score of 94, which is far ahead in the industry.

Golff will continue to serve users with the purpose of security and credibility, and create a DeFi aggregator platform that allows users to rest assured. Strive to create a light, open and free financial world.


### Never forget the Vision, look to the future

Everything in the past is a prologue. In the past year, Golff has built a solid technical foundation from scratch, and has gained the friendship from the broad community of users. We dare not say how much we have changed, but because of you, we have grown a lot.

Next year, Golff will not forget our original goals and set off again. We will actively embrace the changes brought by DeFi and continue to make product breakthroughs. A more complete lending system, a richer income aggregation model, a more complete DAO governance model, and a richer Defi product form will all be our next year. Strive for goals. Wish Golff can become the best choice for everyone to enter the Defi world!
