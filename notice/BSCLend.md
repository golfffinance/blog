Dear Golff Users:

In order to continue to provide diversified financial services and continuously improve the product ecology, Golff Finance will re-launch the BSC Lend at 23:00 (GMT-4) on December 1, 2021, and support G-Token collateralized lending at the same time. Participating in Golff Lend can get GOF mining bonus.



##### **The first phase of BSC Lend supports**

- Regular tokens: BNB, BUSD, USDT, BTCB, ETH, GOF, support collateral and lending, and will gradually support more tokens later.

- Collateralization of G-Token series assets.

  

##### **G-Token collateral lending rules**

- BSC G-Token collateral lending is launched for all tokens in the Farm pool (GOF-BNB LP is not supported at this time).
- The collateral lending rate for the BSC G-Token is 10%.
- The BSC G-Token currently only supports collateral deposit, not lending.

Note: The original Farm rewards will be stopped simultaneously, users need to take out the G-Token from the Farm pool and deposit it into Lend to get the GOF rewards.

Participation address: https://golff.finance/#/lendMarket (switch to BSC network)



BSC Lend allows users to spend less to borrow easily by getting the best lending rates on the BSC. Users can satisfy their deposit/borrowing needs through Golff Lend, allowing depositors to enjoy high interest rates for depositing tokens and borrowers to get a better borrowing cost. At the same time, participating in deposit/loan can get additional mining GOF rewards.

G-Token collateral lending is Golff Finance’s first lending product that uses G-Token (Vault credentials) as collateral, a new model of Vault + lending revolving combination mining. Users can deposit G-Token into the BSC Lend pool to collateralize and lend out any assets, and the borrowed funds can be re-deposited into the Vault or used in other ways to obtain additional revenue. At the same time all G-Token pledged can get additional GOF mining rewards, the original G-Token Fram rewards will all be transferred to the lending pledged rewards.
