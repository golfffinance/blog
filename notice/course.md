Dear Golff users:

According to the previous proposal, in order to better protect the rights of all GOF holding users and the long-term interests of GOF faithful users, Golff Finance will launch the “Course” section with support for BSC and Heco at 20:00 (UTC+8) on September 22, 2021. Golff Finance will upgrade the former GOF Farm pool to VIP Club and invest more additional GOF rewards to build the Course.

Golff Course includes two sub-sections, VIP Club and Carnival, VIP Club supports different locking strategies for pledging GOF, providing various options of current and fixed-term, and mining proceeds can be withdrawn at any time; Carnival gets more token rewards from quality partner projects by pledging GOF.

The details are as follows:

**VIP Club**

- The former GOF Farm pool was upgraded to VIP Club and migrated to the Golff Course segment.
- VIP Club provides more pledge types for GOF holdings users to choose from, including flexible access, and 30-day/90-day/180-day/365-day locked pledges, representing different return weights, users can choose different types according to their needs.
- Pledging Golff NFT (coming soon) can increase the yield weighting, and pledging multiple NFTs can stack the weighting to get higher yield.

**Golff Carnival**

- Carnival is a collaborative mining area launched by Golff and other premium projects, allowing users to participate in the GOF Carnival with occasional lucrative, new and interesting activities.
- Users can pledge GOF in the Carnival to get token rewards from other premium Defi projects.

The Golff Course is designed to increase the equity of all GOF holders, to incentivize long-term recognition of the value of GOF, and to strengthen the long-term interests of faithful GOF users.
